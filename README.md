# Small-Shell-for-the-TMS9900
A small Shell programme to front end the disc and io monitor and to complete the DOS.

It is based on James Hendrix 8080 to complement North Star DOS and was featured in a 1980s article in Dr Dobb's.

This TMS9900 version uses the existing structure but has been recoded to run on a TMS9900 CPM like system.
